# Breast Cancer Detection using Gold Nanoparticles & Artificial Intelligence

### Author: Vaishnavi Bandewar  
Hands-on AI Project using Python + SQL  

---

## Overview
This project integrates **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Gold Nanoparticles (GNPs)** to detect and analyze Breast Cancer cell behavior.  
It demonstrates how AI models can predict biological outcomes based on nanoparticle size and dosage, reducing time and cost in research.

---

## Methodology
1. Created a **dummy dataset** (Size, Dose, Cell Death %).  
2. Stored and queried data using **SQL**.  
3. Imported data into **Python (Google Colab)**.  
4. Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** using `scikit-learn`.  
5. Evaluated results using **Confusion Matrix** and **Classification Report**.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy)  
- SQL Database  
- Google Colab  
- PowerPoint for visualization  

---

## Results & Vision
- Achieved predictive modeling for breast cancer-related data.  
- Demonstrates practical application of AI in **Biomedical & Clinical Research**.  
- Vision: Apply AI to real-world research to enhance accuracy, speed, and cost-efficiency.
